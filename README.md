# Vigenère Cipher Decryptor

This project is a Python script that decrypts messages encrypted using the Vigenère cipher. The script prompts the user to input the ciphertext and the keyword, and then it decrypts the message based on the Vigenère cipher algorithm.

## Features

- **User Input**: Allows users to input the ciphertext and the keyword directly in the terminal or via the web interface.
- **Decryption**: Decrypts the ciphertext using the provided keyword.
- **Simple and Easy to Use**: The script is designed for ease of use, with straightforward input and output.

## New Update

In addition to the Python script, I have attached an `vigenere-cipher-decryptor.html` file that will perform the decryption process in a web browser. You can use this file to decrypt messages without running the Python script.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zappedxd/vigenere-cipher-decryptor.git
   ```
   Or download the files directly from the repository.

2. **Run the Python Script**:
   - Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
   - Run the script using Python:
     ```bash
     python decoder.py
     ```
   - If you are using Python 3, you may need to use:
     ```bash
     python3 decoder.py
     ```

3. **Or Use the HTML File**:
   - Open the `vigenere-cipher-decryptor.html` file in any web browser.
   - Input the ciphertext and the keyword into the form fields.
   - The web page will display the decrypted message.

## Example

### Python Example:
```plaintext
Enter the ciphertext to decrypt: LXFOPVEFRNHR
Enter the keyword: KEY
Decrypted: ATTACKATDAWN
```

### HTML Example:
Open `vigenere-cipher-decryptor.html` in a web browser, input the same ciphertext and keyword, and it will display the decrypted text.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x (for the script)
- A web browser (for the HTML file)
